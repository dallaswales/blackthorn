**Family:** Mother of [[Leonidas Stronghart]]

Cleo Stronghart is a respected elder in Blackthorn, once known for her work as an herbalist. She frequently gathered herbs on [[Mt. Tourmaline]] and ran a successful family apothecary, **Stronghart Potions**, with her husband. After the passing of both her husband and her son, [[Leonidas Stronghart]], Cleo found herself unable to maintain the shop on her own and was eventually forced to sell it. It was rebranded into [[Blue Smoke Tinctures and Brews]] under new ownership.

Cleo asked [[Cedric Blackwood]] to honor Leonidas’s memory at a tree high in the mountains — a place she and her son once visited together. That memorial site serves as a key location in the quest **[[To Honor A Friend]]**.

Though she no longer practices herbalism publicly, Cleo remains a quiet, dignified presence in the town. Her wisdom and history with Blackthorn’s early days give her a quiet authority, even if she rarely asserts it. She has no love for what the old family shop has become.
